# App Code Setup – Repository & Stack Confirmation

1. What is the primary frontend target? (React Native, web, both?)
2. Should we use TypeScript or vanilla JS for this project?
3. Do you want this code hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or another repo?
4. Should we auto-setup a CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment?
5. Are there any required integrations (e.g., Stripe, Firebase, OpenAI)?

Once answered, Codex will scaffold the base structure, connect it to your repo, and generate the starter source files.
